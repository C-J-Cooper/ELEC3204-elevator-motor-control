# ELEC3204 - Elevator Control

Part of a major project for ELEC3204.

This program controls a model elevator using an arduino mega. The arduino mega drives DC motors which can operate in open loop and closed loop control.

Additional features include an emergency stop and an autonomous descent to the ground floor.
